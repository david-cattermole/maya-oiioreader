/*
 * When linking the plugin object, Maya only needs to know about the initialize and
 * uninitialize function symbols, all other symbols can be hidden. This can fix symbol
 * look up clashes when two plugins use different incompatible versions of the same
 * library. This also helps to speed up initial library loading since the number of
 * symbols to load is decreased.
 *
 * Symbols are exported for these functions:
 * initializePlugin(MObject)
 * uninitializePlugin(MObject)
